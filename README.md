This project revolves around leveraging data from the T20 Cricket World Cup 2022 sourced from reputable internet repositories. The dataset was meticulously structured into distinct JSON files encapsulating batting and bowling summaries, player information, and match details. Employing Python's Pandas library, an extensive data cleaning and transformation phase was executed to refine the dataset, handling missing values and ensuring uniformity across records. The transformed data was then converted into CSV files, fostering enhanced accessibility and compatibility. The project's outcome is a comprehensive dataset poised for in-depth analysis, offering valuable insights into player performances, match dynamics, and statistical trends from the T20 Cricket World Cup 2022.
